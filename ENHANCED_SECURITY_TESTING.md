## üì± Feature Testing Instructions

### Auto-Lock After Failed Attempts
1. Go to **Enhanced Security** tab
2. Enable "Auto-Lock After Failed Attempts"
3. Set max attempts to 2 (for testing)
4. Use the test button "Test Auto-Lock" in development mode
5. **Expected Result**: Device locks, alarm plays, security photo captured

### Movement Lock
1. Enable "Movement Detection Lock"
2. Set threshold to 1.5 (sensitive for testing)
3. Shake the device vigorously
4. **Expected Result**: Movement lock triggered, alarm plays

### USB Lock
1. Enable "USB Lock"
2. Connect device to computer via USB
3. Select "File Transfer" mode
4. **Expected Result**: Lock triggered, security alert sent

### Performance Booster
1. Enable "Performance Booster"
2. Tap "Boost Performance Now"
3. **Expected Result**: Cache cleared, optimization report shown

### App Lock
1. Enable "App Lock"
2. Try to open Settings app (if device admin enabled)
3. **Expected Result**: Access blocked with authentication prompt

### Remote Factory Reset
1. Enable "Remote Factory Reset" (‚ö†Ô∏è DANGEROUS)
2. From dashboard, send factory reset command
3. **Expected Result**: Confirmation dialog, requires biometric auth

## üß™ Development Testing Features

In development mode (`__DEV__ = true`), you get additional testing tools:

### Test Modal Access
- Tap "Security Testing (Dev Only)" button
- Manually trigger any security feature
- Test without waiting for real conditions

### Test Commands Available:
```javascript
// Manual testing in console
EnhancedSecurityService.triggerTestAutoLock()
EnhancedSecurityService.triggerTestMovementLock()
EnhancedSecurityService.triggerTestUSBLock()
EnhancedSecurityService.triggerTestPerformanceBoost()
```

## üîß Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Security Testing (Expo Go)
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start Expo: `expo start`
3. Test auto-lock and movement detection
4. Verify alerts and socket communications

### Scenario 2: Advanced Testing (Development Build)
1. Create development build with EAS
2. Install on device with development build
3. Test USB detection and enhanced app protection
4. Verify device admin features (limited)

### Scenario 3: Production Testing (Standalone Build)
1. Build APK with full permissions
2. Install and grant device admin permissions
3. Test complete feature set including:
   - Full USB blocking
   - App uninstall prevention
   - System-level controls

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Warnings & Limitations

### Expo Go Limitations:
- ‚ùå Cannot access system-level permissions
- ‚ùå Limited USB detection capabilities
- ‚ùå Cannot prevent app uninstallation
- ‚ùå Limited device admin features

### Development Build Limitations:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some device admin features require manual permission grants
- ‚ö†Ô∏è USB detection may be limited
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Factory reset testing should be done carefully

### Production Build Considerations:
- üö® Factory reset will actually reset the device
- üö® Uninstall prevention requires device admin setup
- üö® Some features may require root access for full functionality

## üîó Dashboard Integration Testing

### Test Remote Commands:
1. **Remote Lock**: Send lock command from dashboard
2. **Remote Unlock**: Send unlock command from dashboard
3. **Settings Update**: Update security settings remotely
4. **Factory Reset**: Send reset command (BE CAREFUL)

### Verify Alert Delivery:
1. Check dashboard receives security alerts
2. Verify email notifications are sent
3. Confirm socket events are properly transmitted

## üö® Important Safety Notes

1. **Factory Reset Testing**: Only test on development devices
2. **Device Admin**: Carefully manage device admin permissions
3. **USB Lock**: May interfere with development workflow
4. **Movement Lock**: Disable when not testing to avoid accidental locks
5. **Auto-Lock**: Keep max attempts reasonable to avoid lockouts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Permissions denied**: Check app.json permissions
2. **Features not working**: Verify service initialization
3. **Socket connection failed**: Check backend server
4. **Biometric not working**: Ensure device has biometric setup

### Debug Commands:
```javascript
// Check service status
console.log(EnhancedSecurityService.getSecuritySettings())

// Check initialization
console.log(EnhancedSecurityService.isInitialized)

// View security events
console.log(await AsyncStorage.getItem('enhancedSecuritySettings'))
```

This comprehensive testing approach ensures you can develop and verify all security features across different deployment scenarios!
